MVP:

My website will display the data of all the different Valorant agents and their details. Users will be able to register an account, log into that account and interact with the favorites tab I will create. However users can still view all the agents and their details if they choose not to register an account.

- Users can browse the Valorant agents and their details on the home screen
- Users can type in the agents name in an input field to filter to that specific agent
- Users can navigate to the register/login page where they can create an account
- Logged in users can add certain agent to theur favorites tab
- Logged in users can also remove said agents from their favorites tab

Pages:
Home Screen
Register Screen
Login Screen
Favorites Screen

- Valorant agent info (that is displayed on the home screen) will be organized into a database that I will create
